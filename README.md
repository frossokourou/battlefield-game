# Battlefield game #

A fully functional battlefield game between you and the computer. You can try it live [here](https://battlefield-game.herokuapp.com).

### What tools did I use? ###

* React.js
* Redux.js
* Atom text editor

### Why did I build it? ###

After diving into the basics of front-end development and being excited with React.js I wanted to build a real app in order to:
* Practice what I have learned
* Create an App from scratch by myself
* Solve real-world coding problems while developing the App

### Future plans ###

* Enhance the App into a real web application (I am currently learning the server stuff)
* Add functionality for games between two users
* Use my imagination to make something unique (sky is the limit)
